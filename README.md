# CRediT translations from English into other languages

The repository is for translations of [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/). The translations are unofficial (NISO policy is that although they welcome translations, they do not endorse any particular translation as official).

Translations here are stored as JSON files. The human-readable translations are generated automatically from the JSON files as markdown and can be viewed on the Contributorship Collaboration's website at [https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/).

Each translation was provided by volunteers, and  attribution and license is listed.

## New contributors welcome!

## Notes for programmers and project coordinators

How the translation file is created:
JSON->new file table of finished languages .md->HTML

How the polished landing page is created, including the [human-readable translations](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/projects/translation/completed/):

Hugo partial, then the top of the page can be edited without affecting the rendering of the list of languages. 
The rendering is done by Github Action which can be triggered by editing the [webpage repo](https://github.com/contributorshipcollaboration/contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/blob/master/README.md
)
