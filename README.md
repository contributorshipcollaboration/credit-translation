# CRediT translations from English into other languages

The repository is for translations of [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/). The translations are unofficial (NISO policy is that although they welcome translations, they do not endorse any particular translation as official).

Translations here are stored as JSON files. The human-readable translations are generated automatically from the JSON files as markdown and can be viewed on the Contributorship Collaboration's website at [https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/).

Each translation was provided by volunteers, and  attribution and license is listed.

## New contributors welcome!
